disadvantages of nestegg
-------------------------
- non-standard looking stack trace
- deep levels of nesting are likely to stuff it up
- need to check if deep levels of nesting will stuff it up



- include the new gem in Escort to replace the nesting stuff that is in there right now
- do a blog post about Ruby nested exceptions
